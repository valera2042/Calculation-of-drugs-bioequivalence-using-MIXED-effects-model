In generalized linear models (GLM) all effects are treated as fixed effects for calculations, 
whereas MIXED model is specifically designed to accurately compute mixed-effects models, incorporating random effects. 
the MIXED model offers a superior linear unbiased estimator of random effects compared to GLM in BE analysis [here](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7781810/)
